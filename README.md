## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Major learnings include learning how to position div elements the and objects inside of the div elements optimally as well as developing an eye for detail and trying to match up the fonts, image size, and paddings as much as possible. 

I used a container div element, which housed the box div element. On that container I used various CSS properties to place the container in the center of the screen, horizontally and vertically. Then in the box div element I housed my image of the QR code as well as the text. I had tinker around a lot with the width of the image, as well as the paddings of the text, to ensure that it matches the original as much as possible. 

Regarding the fonts, I eyeballed the original and looked for alternatives for use in my project. I did use websites that specialize in font recognition but their suggestions were locked behind a paywall so I didn't use them.

For the background, I took a screensho of the design images and used the color picker from Paint.net to get the exact colour so didn't have any troubles doing that

### Continued development

I can say withtout a doubt that I still need lots more work with CSS. Especially when it comes to positioning the elements inside of div elements and then using CSS properties like Flexbox to ensure that it meets my requirements for both mobile and deskptop previews.
